# Description

It's a website with my own music. 

This website was developed to showcase my musical works. By clicking on the button at the top, you can enable the music that accompanies you on the site. Furthermore, I created a piano using CSS. The idea was that each key would play a specific track when pressed. This project is not yet complete as the JavaScript code to optimize this process has not been written. The SCSS code has not been written either to ensure that the entire code functions well in all browsers.
